I was a research assistant at Zhejiang University, advised by [Prof. Wenbo Shen](https://wenboshen.org/). Prior to this, I was a visiting scholar at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by [Prof. Yueqi Chen](http://cusecurity.cs.colorado.edu/yueqichen/). I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from Jiangxi Normal University at 2022.

Use #bibitem_Venue_Key to refer to "Venue:Key".

It is possible to have multiple BibTeX blocks, which will be rendered independently. For example, you might want to have one block for each of "Publications", "Pre-prints", and "Manuscripts".

To support more information links (e.g., add "slides" or "pdf" links),
see "builder/marked.0.3.6/bibtex-service.js" line 109.
}
