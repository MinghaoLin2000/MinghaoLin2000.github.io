Now I am an independent security researcher who is a member of [Terminal OS Architecture & Security Team (TOAST) ](https://toast-research.github.io/). Previously, I was a research assistant at Zhejiang University, advised by [Prof. Wenbo Shen](https://wenboshen.org/). Prior to this, I was a visiting scholar at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by [Prof. Yueqi Chen](http://cusecurity.cs.colorado.edu/yueqichen/). I also worked closely with [Prof. Mingxue Zhang](https://zhangmx1997.github.io/) at Zhejiang University. I obtained my bachelorâ€™s degree from Jiangxi Normal University at 2022.  

During university, as a CTF enthusiast, I founded the [Hyacinth Information Security Studio (JXNUSEC)](https://www.jxnusec.cn) to officially represent my university to participate CTF contest. Each year, the team provides cybersecurity training to students across the university and selects new members, aiming to inspire more undergraduates and graduates to join the cybersecurity field. Our team has grown to 30 members. Thanks to our competition achievements, **we advocated for cybersecurity competitions to be added points for postgraduate study and contributed to the establishment of a cybersecurity major in the college.** 

My research focuses on system/architecture security, targeting different targets from small devices to operating systems. I thoroughly enjoy understanding how a system is built, which drives my interest in exploring open-source code and using my reverse engineering skills, honed in CTF competitions, to analyze closed-source systems. Based on this understanding, I approach systems from three perspectives: attack, defense, and optimization, uncovering new challenges. In my previous work, I focused heavily on attack existing systems, but I am now shifting toward building a secure and efficient system. 

So far, I have discovered **[numerous bugs](#bugs)** in well-known targets with my teammates and friends, **receiving over 70 CVEs and $30000 from various vendors (Apple/Microsoft/Amazon/Google)**. 

I also enjoy sharing my skills with the security community. Iâ€™ve written several writeups detailing techniques for hacking mobile games and tackling complex obfuscations during reverse engineering. Two of my most viewed writeups are listed below (Chinese version):
- [2022 Tencent Game Security Competition Android Client Finals Writeup](https://bbs.kanxue.com/thread-272519.htm)
- [2022 Tencent Game Security Competition Android Client Preliminary Writeup](https://bbs.kanxue.com/thread-272518.htm)


**I am applying for a PhD position.**
